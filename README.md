# CLI (Command Line Interface)
- ls -> lists content of current directory
- cd -> change directory
- mkdir -> makes a new directory
- touch -> creates a file

# Git vs GitHub
- git init -> allows a project to use git commands
- git status -> shows what has been added/changed/deleted since your last commit
- git add -> move files/folders to the staging area
- git commit -m "message" -> takes everything from the staging area and makes it permanent
- git diff -> show the difference in files since the last commit
- git remote -> shows connection to other places such as GitHub
  - git remote add -> creates a new remote connection
  - git remote -v -> verbose = more details
- git push -> copies your code to wherever you are sending it remotely

# Three stages
- working directory
- staging area
- project
